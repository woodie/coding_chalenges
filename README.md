# Coding Challenges

The purpose of this repo is to help me `white board` these examples
in any of these languages and be able to quickly context shift.

Note: Some of these solutions have not been optimized.

## Setup

For the typescript sheband, we need [this wrapper](https://gist.github.com/woodie/b31ae19e9522fc3ed226) and this module: `npm i --save-dev @types/node`.

The `Ruby` and `Python` examples should just work although some my need to be updated to version 3.

The `Go` and `Rust` examples are sparce but we hope to add more.

## Linting
```
standardrb --fix filename.rb
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive filename.py
```
